All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

For now this repository is set to private till I finish uploading all files and organising them. Once done, I will move that to a branch to keep an unedited original 1.0 version of the project while anyone who wants to can fork and work on the main branch. Depending on the results, they can be incorporated back into this repository as improvements and additional features.
